  <p> Maria Coloca hails from a beautiul island in Goa called Chorao de Graca. She has always been fond of cooking. <br>
    Her specialities includes main courses like Sorpotel, Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo, Croquettes and many more. <br>
    Some of her signature sweets are the world famous Goan Sweets like Patoleos (steamed sweet dish), <br>
    Baath (Goan coconut cake), Bolina (Goan coconut cookies) and Pinagr. <br>
  </p>
  <p> Colaco Delicacies was set up in 2017 as a means to introdice more people to authentic Goan cuisine. <br>
    Initially it was just Christmas cakes and sweets, however, the overwhelming response from regulars encouraged <br>
    Maria to venture into savoury food and authentic Goan pickles. These recipes hail from her grandmother's kitchen. <br>
